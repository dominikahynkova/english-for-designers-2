*Im a town girl living her life in the big city called Prague. If you saw someone making fun of someone well that would be me and it was pleasure to meet you. I consider myself as hardworking but making propriet coffe brainstorming breaks. As you can see from my portfolio I’m up to everything. Illustration, visual identity, web and least but not last run.*
