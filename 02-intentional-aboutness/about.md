I’m a village girl living her life in the big city of Prague. If you see someone making fun of someone. well that would be me, and it was pleasure to meet you. I consider myself hardworking but with proper coffee brainstorming breaks. As you can see from my portfolio I’m up to for everything, from Illustration and visual identity to web, and last but not least, even a run with me.
